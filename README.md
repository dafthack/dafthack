# Beau Bullock

Hi, I'm Beau. I hack things and play guitar. Since 2014 I have been carrying out penetration tests and red team assessments for <a href="https://blackhillsinfosec.com">Black Hills Information Security</a>. I contribute as much as I can to the InfoSec community by authoring open-source tools, speaking at conferences and on webcasts, writing blogs, and teaching the training course that I authored, <a href="https://breakforge.io">Breaching the Cloud</a>. 

<a href="https://nobandwidth.io">NOBANDWIDTH</a> is my primary musical endeavor that is heavily inspired by both cyberpunk media and retro-futurism. The compositions are a combination of dark synthwave and metal along with some lead guitar work. A theme of "music to hack to" can be found throughout the tracks.
