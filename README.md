# Beau Bullock

Hi, I'm Beau. I hack things and
play guitar. Since 2014 I have
been carrying out penetration
tests and red team assessments
for <a href="https://blackhillsinfosec.com">Black Hills Information</a>
<a href="https://blackhillsinfosec.com">Security</a>. I contribute as much
as I can to the InfoSec community
by authoring open-source tools,
speaking at conferences and on
webcasts, writing blogs, and
teaching the training course that
I authored, <a href="https://breakforge.io">Breaching the Cloud</a>.

<a href="https://nobandwidth.io">NOBANDWIDTH</a> is my primary
musical endeavor that is heavily
inspired by both cyberpunk media
and retro-futurism. The compositions
are a combination of dark synthwave
and metal along with some lead
guitar work. A theme of "music to
hack to" can be found throughout
the tracks.
